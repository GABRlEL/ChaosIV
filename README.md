# ChaosIV

*ChaosIV* is a Chaos mod for Grand Theft Auto IV inspired by similar mods for GTA V and GTA:SA.
The mod has been tested to work with 1.0.4.0 and 1.0.7.0, though it may likely also work with 1.0.8.0 and the Complete Edition. 

This mod requires an ASI loader and .NET ScriptHook in order to be installed.
To install, simply drop the ChaosIV.net.dll file into the scripts folder within your GTA IV installation.

For Complete Edition, install the Compatibility Patch after the ASI Loader and ScriptHook: https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta4mods/g17media/26726-compatibility-patch-for-gta-iv-complete-edition/

## How to Contribute
Make sure you have your ASI loader and .NET ScriptHook installed, and then clone the repo into the "for Developers" folder within the scripts folder.
When you build the mod, GTA IV will automatically launch so you can test immediately.
