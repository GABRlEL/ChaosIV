# ChaosIV
*ChaosIV* is a Chaos mod for Grand Theft Auto IV inspired by similar mods for GTA V and GTA:SA.

## Requirements
+ GTA IV v1.0.8.0 (though it may run on older versions with the relevant tools, I am incapable of supporting them)
+ Ultimate ASI Loader v4.5.2
+ .NET ScriptHook v1.7.1.8

## Installation
1. Ensure you have the Razor1911 launcher installed, so to prevent unexpected "drunk cam" or other issues.
2. Install [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases) and [.NET ScriptHook](https://gtaforums.com/topic/946154-release-gtaiv-net-scripthook-v1718-support-for-gta-iv-1080-and-eflc-1130-by-arinc9-zolika1351/) by following the relevant instructions.
3. Drop "ChaosIV.net.dll" into the scripts folder.
